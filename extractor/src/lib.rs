//! This module defines custom extractors used within the application,
//! providing specialized ways to retrieve and process data from incoming requests.
//!
//! Each extractor here is implemented to simplify request handling and ensure
//! type-safe access to specific request data. Extractors are designed to handle
//! common validation, authorization, or data transformation logic when interacting
//! with the applicationâ€™s API endpoints.
