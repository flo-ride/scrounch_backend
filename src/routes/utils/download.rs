//! Utility functions for handling file downloads.
//!
//! This module provides functions to facilitate the downloading of files
//! from the server, including setting appropriate headers and streaming
//! file content to the client. It aims to simplify the process of
//! serving files in a web application.

/// Downloads files from the server's storage.
///
/// This function retrieves a specified file based on the given filename
/// and type, and streams it to the client. It also handles errors
/// related to file access, returning appropriate HTTP status codes
/// for various scenarios such as file not found or other errors.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `filename`: The name of the file to be downloaded.
/// - `params`: The type of the file, which affects the download behavior.
///
/// # Responses
/// - `200`: The file is correctly uploaded.
/// - `400`: You're missing some field.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns an error if the file does not exist or if there is an issue
/// with the S3 storage.
